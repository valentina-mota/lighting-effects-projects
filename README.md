# Lighting Effects Projects

This repository contains two distinct web projects that demonstrate different lighting effects implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project showcases a unique technique for creating interactive and visually appealing effects that follow the user's mouse movement across the screen.

## Projects

### 1. Flashlight Effect

The **Flashlight Effect** simulates a flashlight that follows the user's mouse cursor, illuminating a portion of the screen while the rest remains in shadow. This effect is created using Vanilla JavaScript to dynamically update CSS variables based on the mouse's position.

- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Folder**: `flashlight-effect`
- **Key Features**:
  - Simple and lightweight implementation
  - No external libraries required
  - Real-time mouse tracking

### 2. Spotlight Effect

The **Spotlight Effect** (also referred to as the "Mouse-Following Light Effect") creates a more complex and customizable lighting effect using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to smoothly animate the position of a light circle that reveals content underneath as it follows the user's mouse movement.

- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
- **Folder**: `spotlight-effect`
- **Key Features**:
  - Smooth and precise animations using GSAP
  - Customizable easing and animation duration
  - Enhanced user experience with fluid transitions

## Acknowledgments

- **GSAP**: The Spotlight Effect leverages the power of GSAP for smooth animations.
- These projects are inspired by Michelle Barkerâ€™s article ["Dynamic CSS Masks with Custom Properties and GSAP"](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/05/04/dynamic-css-masks-with-custom-properties-and-gsap/).
