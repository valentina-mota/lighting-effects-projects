# Flashlight Effect

The Flashlight Effect is a simple yet interactive web project that simulates a flashlight following the user's mouse cursor. As the mouse moves, a portion of the screen is illuminated while the rest remains in shadow, creating a dynamic and engaging visual effect.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How It Works

This project uses Vanilla JavaScript to dynamically update CSS variables based on the mouse's position. The CSS `background-image` property, with a `radial-gradient`, creates the flashlight effect that moves smoothly across the screen.
