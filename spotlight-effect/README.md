# Spotlight Effect

The Spotlight Effect (also referred to as the "Mouse-Following Light Effect") is a web project that creates a sophisticated and customizable lighting effect using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). The light circle follows the user's mouse movement, revealing content underneath and creating a smooth, interactive experience.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

## How It Works

This project leverages GSAP to animate the position of a light circle that tracks the mouse. The CSS `clip-path` property, combined with GSAP, allows for precise and fluid animation, enhancing the overall user experience.
